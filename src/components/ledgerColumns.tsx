 * The cohort ledger's columns — one definition, shared.

 * ── Why this left the QC page ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The ledger moved to its own screen and the new page re-declared a shortened version of
 * this list. It rendered 13 of 25 columns, which is not a smaller table — it is a different
 * report with the same headings, missing "Call queue", "Direct mail", "No insured contact",
 * "Unworked A", "Lost", "Workable lost %" and the rest. Nobody comparing the two would have
 * been able to say which was right.
 *
 * Every column here carries its own meaning and several carry a tooltip explaining a number
 * that has been argued about before. Copying a subset of them by hand is how those
 * explanations get lost.
 */
/**
 * The real row type, imported rather than restated.
 *
 * Type-only: the service reads @/lib/neon, and a value import would pull the database
 * client into this bundle. The import is erased at compile time.
 *
 * This matters beyond tidiness. The Cohorts page originally typed its own row shape by hand
 * and invented three field names — climbedIn, toCall, mailablePct — which compiled fine and
 * threw "Cannot read properties of undefined" on first render. Against the real type those
 * three are errors before the page is ever opened.
