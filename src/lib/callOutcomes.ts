   *
   *   callback scheduled  spoke to them, agreed a time — and the intro email still went

   *   do not call         they said stop — and the sequence went on sending
   *
   * The last one is not an annoyance. suppress() writes a Suppression row, which stops the
   * NEXT push; it does not touch the platform, so a sequence already running keeps running.
   * Only stopHousehold() removes the contact. A household that asked us to stop went on
   * being mailed until the sequence ran out.
   *
   * Frank and Ruben settled the rule on 29 Sep 2026. Ruben: "they confirmed their email,
   * they seem interested — for that card we should just not be automated outreach to them
   * since they're already engaged." Frank: "cease all automation outreach via email."
   *
   * That rule is "we reached a person", which this file already records as `reached`. So
   * the sequence stop is derived from it rather than carried beside it, and a new outcome
   * cannot be added that reaches somebody and forgets to stop the email — which is the only
   * way the three lines above could have happened.
