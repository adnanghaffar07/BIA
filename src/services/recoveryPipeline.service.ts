/**
 * The contact-recovery pipeline (Frank, 18 Sep 2026).
 *
 * An isolated lead — Grade A, quote-ready, no insured email — is worked through two
 * vendors in a fixed order, and each stage is a tab in QC → Blast Skip Traces:
 *
 *   isolated  ──Tracerfy──▶  recovered
 *        │
 *        └── no data ──▶  tracerfy  ──BatchData──▶  recovered
 *                              │
 *                              └── no data ──▶  batchdata   (exhausted)
 *
 * ── Why the stage is stored and not derived ─────────────────────────────────
 * It could be inferred from timestamps, but inference breaks as soon as a lead is traced
 * for some other reason, and these tabs are COUNTED on. A tab whose population is guessed
 * is a tab whose numbers get argued about, which is the entire history of this project.
 *
 * ── What counts as recovered ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An insured EMAIL. That is what isolation means and therefore what ends it — a lead that
 * gains only a phone is still unmailable and stays in the pipeline, though the phone is
 * kept and reported, because it is worth having and Ruben can call it.
