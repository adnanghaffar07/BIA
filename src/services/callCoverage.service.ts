/**
 * How much of the calling has actually been done — per number, not per card.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Frank, 1 Oct 2026: "On 9/29 only 8 cards had a call outcome logged, so we can't tell a
 * dead number from an unanswered one." He then asked Ruben directly whether every account
 * in C1 had been called, and said he was "a little blind here".
 *
 * Nobody could answer, because nothing counted it. The card shows its own attempts and the
 * queue hands out the next lead, but there was no view that put numbers held against
 * numbers worked. On C1 that gap was 326 numbers on file against 15 with an outcome, and
 * 55 of 62 cards never touched — a fact that had gone unremarked through two weeks of
 * calling and two rounds of questions about why contact rates were low.
 *
 * ── Per number, because that is the unit of work ────────────────────────────
 * A card with six numbers and one voicemail is not a worked card, but every per-card
 * measure counts it as one. That is how "we called them" and "we reached nobody" both
 * stayed true at the same time. Frank's Friday readout asks for connects, wrong numbers
 * and disconnects per card against 9/29, and none of those divide out of a card-level
 * count.
 *
 * ── Dialled is matched on digits ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The attempt stores whatever the panel sent it and the card stores whatever the vendor
 * returned, so "(732) 555-0101" and "7325550101" are the same number written twice. Compared
 * as strings they are two, and the coverage figure silently flatters itself.
