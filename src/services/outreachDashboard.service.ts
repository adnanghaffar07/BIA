/**
 * The outreach dashboard (directive Sec. 10.7).
 *
 * ── Where the definitions come from ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not invented here. Every stage, target and pause rule below is transcribed from Frank's
 * own KPI Tracker (v12 Target Model) — the funnel in section 1, the guardrails in section
 * 2. Building a dashboard on a second set of definitions would produce a screen that
 * disagrees with the spreadsheet it is meant to replace, which is worse than no screen.
 *
 * ── The funnel is a ladder, and each rung divides by the one above ──────────
 * That matters: a rate is only meaningful against its own denominator. "Coverage" is
 * cards-with-email over Grade A WORKED, not over Grade A at pull, because a lead that
 * left Grade A was never a candidate. Quoting one denominator as another is how a funnel
 * reports 61% and 81% for the same week, which is discrepancy D2 in Frank's own log.
 *
 * ── Honest zeroes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything from "people emailed" down reads zero until outreach starts, and that is
 * reported as "not started" rather than as a failing rate. A dashboard that shows 0%
 * engagement before a single email has gone out is not measuring engagement; it is
 * measuring that nothing has happened, and the two must not look alike.
