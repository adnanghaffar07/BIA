/**
 * Make the sending platform agree with the CRM (directive Sec. 11.5, question 4).
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When a homeowner engages, stopHousehold() marks the siblings stopped in our own
 * database inside a transaction — that part is atomic and reliable — and then calls the
 * platform to remove each one. Removal is the only mechanism that provably halts sends:
 * the vendor has no pause-one-lead endpoint (verified live, /leads/{id}/pause is "Route
 * not found" and PATCH silently discards `status`).
 *
 * If that removal call fails, it is recorded in `failedOnPlatform` and returned to the
 * caller — and then nothing ever happens again. The CRM shows the address as stopped.
 * The platform keeps sending to it. Nobody finds out until the homeowner complains
 * about being chased after they already replied.
 *
 * That is not a bug in stopHousehold; recording first and removing second is the right
 * way round. It is a missing second half. This is the second half.
 *
 * ── What "converged" means here ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The honest promise is not "instantly". It is: whatever the platform thinks right now,
 * within one sweep it will agree with us about who must stop. A weaker claim that is
 * actually true beats a stronger one that is true most of the time — the failure mode of
 * the stronger claim is a customer receiving mail we told them we had stopped.
 *
 * ── What this will NOT do ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Removal is destructive and irreversible on the vendor's side. So this only ever removes
 * a recipient the CRM can point at a reason for: an OutreachEvent already marked stopped,
 * or an active Suppression covering that address or its household.
 *
 * A live recipient the CRM has never heard of is REPORTED and left alone. It could be a
 * manual add, another team's test, or our own row that failed to write — and deleting
 * somebody else's campaign members because our database looks empty is a far worse
 * outcome than a stale recipient. `unknown` exists to be looked at, not acted on.
