 * by an earlier attempt too stays invalidated; a suppression somebody else recorded stays.
 *
 * ── Why there is a time limit ───────────────────────────────────────────────

 * an attempt is a record of what happened, and a producer who wants it changed should say

 * "what if something is done incorrectly or a mistake was made and you wanted to get it
 * back — things get stuck in here."
 *
 * ── Not an undo, and deliberately not one ───────────────────────────────────
 * The undo deletes an attempt and is limited to ten minutes, because past that an attempt
 * is a record of a call that really happened and the call log is what contactability is
 * computed from. This deletes nothing. It draws a line and says the calling story starts
 * again after it — so the card keeps both the calls and the fact that somebody set them
 * aside, which is precisely what a wider undo window would have destroyed.
 *
 * ── What it does reverse ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Back in the queue" has to mean actually callable, or it is a button that appears to work.
 * A number one of those attempts marked bad stays out of rotation unless this clears it —
 * the lead would return to the queue with nothing dialable on it. So invalidations caused by
 * the discounted attempts are lifted, by the same test the undo uses: only where no OTHER
 * attempt independently condemned that number.
 *
 * ── What it refuses to reverse ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A suppression. "Not interested" and "do not call" are a person's own words, and quietly
 * lifting one to tidy a queue is how a household that asked us to stop gets rung again. If
 * the calls being set aside produced a live suppression, this refuses and says so; releasing
