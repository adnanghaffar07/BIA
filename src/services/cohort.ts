 * "Lead"."cohort" is maintained by the lead_cohort_trg trigger (migration 021), because
 * effectiveDate is written from several places — two of them generic builders that
 * assemble columns from a payload — and any app-side derivation would eventually drift.
 * What is here MIRRORS that trigger for labelling, filtering and stamping a send; it is
 * not where the value comes from. If one changes, change both.
 *
 * ── Why Monday-to-Sunday and not Frank's window ──────────────────────────────
 * Frank names a pull inclusively: "11/09/2026 to 11/16/2026". Taken literally that is
 * eight days, and consecutive pulls share a Monday — on the live data that window holds
 * 1,519 leads, of which 149 are dated 11/16 and also belong to the following week. A tag
 * has to partition, so the stored cohort is the non-overlapping week. Reports keep
 * taking an explicit from/to range and are unchanged by this.
