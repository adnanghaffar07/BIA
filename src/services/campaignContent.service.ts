/**
 * Fill in what was actually sent: the mailbox that sent it and the copy it carried.
 *
 * ── Why this exists rather than relying on the webhook ───────────────────────
 * Two reasons, and either alone would justify it.
 *
 * First, the webhook is not wired in production yet — the vendor dashboard still has to
 * be pointed at /api/webhooks/campaign — so without this the sending-mailbox and content
 * columns would be empty for every send until that happens, including sends already
 * made.
 *
 * Second, even once it is wired, a webhook is a single delivery attempt against an
 * endpoint that can be down, redeployed mid-request, or simply never called for an event
 * type the vendor decides not to emit. The message feed is queryable after the fact, so
 * it is the thing that can be reconciled. The webhook makes the CRM live; this makes it
 * correct.
 *
 * ── Why the copy is stored rather than read from the campaign ────────────────
 * A campaign's sequence can be edited at any time. The copy the campaign holds today is
 * not necessarily the copy a homeowner received last week, so "which subject line did
 * this cohort get" is unanswerable from the campaign itself. Captured once per send,
 * never refreshed.
