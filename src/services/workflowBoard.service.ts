/**
 * The workflow board (Frank, 29 Sep 2026).
 *
 * "Anytime there's real engagement, whether it's on the phone or the email, it should both
 *  correlate into a workflow that has action items... broken out in boxes by cohort, and you
 *  can click into the box, you can see emails, anything responding to, follow-ups, callbacks,
 *  quote issued follow-up — if it was issued and no response in three days, that's a trigger
 *  flag. That's a real workflow dashboard. You don't miss anything."
 *
 * ── Why this is not another report ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every other screen in this CRM answers "what is true". This one answers "what is owed" —
 * the things a person said they would do and has not done yet. A lead sitting in five
 * reports and nobody's list is the failure mode Frank is describing, and it costs an account
 * rather than a number in a table.
 *
 * ── Every item is DERIVED, and every one can close itself ───────────────────
 * Nothing here is a task somebody ticks off. An item exists because a fact about the lead
 * says work is outstanding, and it disappears when the fact changes — a reply is owed until
 * somebody rings, a callback is owed until the next attempt, a quote is stale until it binds
 * or is lost. A stored to-do list would need closing by hand, and the first one nobody closed
 * would make the whole board untrustworthy.
 *
 * That also means the board cannot disagree with the cards it is built from, which is the
 * defect this project has spent a fortnight removing everywhere else.
 *
 * ── Ordered by renewal proximity, never by age ──────────────────────────────
 * Frank: "if it's closer to the effective date, that means it's more pressing than if it's
 * further." A three-day-old item on a renewal in November matters less than a same-day one
 * renewing on Monday, so the cohort is the first sort and the clock is shown inside it.
