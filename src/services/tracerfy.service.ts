 * real, ranked owner contacts with DNC/TCPA/carrier flags.
 *
 * Endpoint (verified live): POST https://tracerfy.com/v1/api/trace/enhanced/lookup/
 *   body: { first_name, last_name, address, city, state, zip }  auth: Bearer <TRACERFY_API_KEY>
 *   → { hit, persons:[{ first_name, last_name, age, mailing_address:{street,...},
 *        phones:[{ number, type, dnc, tcpa, carrier, rank }], emails:[{ email, rank }] }],
 *        credits_deducted }   (15 credits per hit, 0 on miss)
 *
 * The insured/co-insured/DOB logic already exists for the old provider, so we normalize
 * Tracerfy's people onto that person shape and reuse it verbatim.

// name on file cannot be traced at all now that the address-based lookup is gone. Callers
// must gate on the name being present rather than letting this throw.
