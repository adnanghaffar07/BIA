/**
 * The surname review list (Frank, 24 Sep 2026 · second email §7).
 *
 * "A surname match between every skip-trace-recovered address and the insured or
 *  co-insured. Failures go to a review list, not into a send."
 *
 * ── Why this cannot be left to email verification ───────────────────────────
 * Frank, in the same paragraph: "Email verification will not catch this. It confirms a
 * mailbox exists, not that it belongs to the person. It will pass this address and the send
 * will still be wrong."
 *
 * The account that prompted it has insured Claudia Garcia, co-insured Cesar Garcia, and one
 * address: dburnette19@gmail.com. A verifier says that mailbox is live, and it is — it
 * belongs to somebody else. Sending there discloses a stranger's property details and
 * estimated premium, from a domain with no sending history to absorb the complaint.
 *
 * ── Only the addresses that would actually be MAILED are checked ────────────
 * Not every address on a card: a queue padded with addresses nobody was going to use is a
 * queue nobody finishes. The test is "would this be sent to", and it is asked of the same
 * function the send list and the push ask.
 *
 * That used to mean ONE address per person, the top-ranked one. Frank changed it on 28 Sep
 * — "individual emails sent to each of the insured's verified emails, we are not sure which
 * will be primary so we must outreach all" — and this was not changed with it. The rule kept
 * being enforced, against the wrong population: every address gained by that change went out
 * unchecked, because the queue was still asking about the top-ranked one.
 *
 * Measured on 29 Sep before the fix: 1,583 trace-recovered addresses stood on the live send
 * list and NOT ONE had been name-checked. 359 of them failed the check once it was run.
 *
 * The lesson is not "remember to update both". It is that this must ask the same question
 * the send asks, in the same words — hence allInsuredAddresses / allCoInsuredAddresses, the
 * functions the send list and the push themselves call. When the sending rule changes again,
 * this changes with it.
 *
 * ── Held by default, released deliberately ──────────────────────────────────
 * An undecided row keeps its address out of every send. Approving is an act by a named
 * person. The failure this guards against is silent release, so absence of a decision means
 * hold rather than proceed.
