 * Who gets which line. §5 varies the subject by segment, cohort, step and A/B variant —
 * priced copy only to priced accounts, C6/C7 introducing before they quote, Grade B on the

 * A lookup that finds nothing falls back to the compiled function. A subject line is the
 * one field an email cannot send without: a blank subject is both an unopened email and a
 * spam signal, so there is no path here that returns an empty string.
