/**
 * The Grade B cohort ledger.
 *
 * ── Why this is not the Grade A ledger with a filter ────────────────────────
 * That one measures GRADE RETENTION: Grade A at pull → downgraded → low point → regained →
 * Grade A now, against Frank's 5% loss target. Every column is about holding a grade.
 *
 * A Grade B lead is not being held at anything. It is out of appetite on a roof nobody has
 * confirmed, and the only question worth asking is whether we can reach it: is it in the
 * band Frank set, has it been traced, did the trace find an address, did the address verify.
 * Running Grade B through the retention columns would produce a table where "downgraded"
 * and "regained A" are permanently zero and the one number that matters is absent.
 *
 * So it is its own funnel, measured on the same renewal weeks so the two can be read side
 * by side.
 *
 *   in the cohort → in the roof band → queued → traced → has an address → verified → mailable
 *
 * ── Why "in the roof band" is a stage and not a filter ──────────────────────
 * Frank's criterion is homes 21 to 76 years old. A Grade B outside it is not a lead we are
 * choosing to skip — it is one no carrier will write, and the difference between "we have
 * not got to them" and "they are not eligible" is the whole point of a ledger.
