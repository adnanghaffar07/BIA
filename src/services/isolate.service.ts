/**
 * Isolating the unreachable (register A41).
 *
 * ── What "isolated" means ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Grade A with no insured email: a lead we would quote and cannot email. It is not lost,
 * not out of appetite, and not a producer's mistake — it is waiting on a contact detail.
 * Left at 'rated' it reads as part of the send list, and the first anyone learns otherwise
 * is when a cohort under-delivers against its own forecast.
 *
 * ── Isolation is its own field, NOT a status ────────────────────────────────
 * It used to overwrite status with 'isolated', keeping the old value in isolatedFromStatus
 * to put back later. That preserved the data and still broke every reader in between:
 * anything asking "is this lead rated" got "no" for as long as it was parked, which is how
 * the dashboard came to report 48 rated for a week holding 61.
 *
 * Frank, 23 Sep 2026: "A separate 'isolated' dropdown will be added, so pulling a lead for
 * skip trace never overwrites its 'rated' status."
 *
 * So isolatedAt is the marker and status is left alone. A lead that was rated stays rated
 * while it waits for an address, which is what it actually is — rated AND unreachable are
 * two different facts about the same lead and were never alternatives to each other.
 *
 * isolatedFromStatus is still written, and still read on the way out, because 46 leads were
 * isolated under the old rule and their real status is only recoverable from it.
 *
 * ── Why this is an action, not a rule ───────────────────────────────────────
 * It would be easy to have the report isolate leads as it renders them. That would make
 * running a report change the data, which is how a screen stops being a reliable place to
 * look. Somebody presses the button; it is recorded; it can be undone.

       * those at the "not yet attempted" stage would queue them for the very vendor that
