/**
 * The phone outreach dashboard (Frank, 25 Sep 2026).
 *
 * "Mirror email outreach dashboard; filter by cohort, date, and no-verified-email accounts
 *  based on the final verified email results... C1-C3 total rated = 178, Total verified
 *  Insured email = 106, Non-verified = 72. We call these first and as soon as ready."
 *
 * ── Why this is not just the email dashboard with a different column ────────
 * The email dashboard answers "how is the campaign doing". This answers "who does Ruben ring
 * next", which is a different question with a different shape: it is a queue, ordered, and
 * its top line is the accounts email cannot reach at all.
 *
 * The three numbers Frank quotes are the whole point — rated, of those reachable by a
 * verified address, and the remainder. That remainder is the work. Everything else here
 * exists to say how far through it we are.
 *
 * ── Verified means a verifier said so ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Not "we hold an address". Those differ by 26 accounts on C1–C3 alone, and the 26 look
 * reachable in every other report. Until a verification run lands, `verified` is zero and
 * the dashboard says so rather than reporting the whole book as unreachable.
