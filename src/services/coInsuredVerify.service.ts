/**
 * Is the co-insured on the card the person the tax roll names?
 *
 * ── Why this needed no new lookup ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * WIIP never returned "the owner" — it returns the whole deed line, both names, and
 * ownerVerifyName has held it verbatim since the first blast: "SCOTTO, DIANE & MICHAEL".
 * So the second owner has been verifiable all along. What was missing was somewhere to put
 * the answer: the insured's sits on the card as ownerVerifyStatus and can be filtered and
 * counted, while the co-insured's existed only inside the override tool. "Show me every
 * card where the co-insured disagrees with the roll" was not a question anybody could ask,
 * and on 2 Oct the answer was 118 cards.
 *
 * ── Derived, never guessed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every status below comes from a record we already hold. A card with no WIIP record gets
 * null rather than a status — not knowing is not the same as knowing there is nobody, and
 * a verification that answers for an unchecked card is worse than one that stays silent.

 * ── Two corrections that cost this report its first draft ───────────────────
 * The first version compared the card's co-insured against parseRollOwners' second party
 * and nothing else, and it called three of its first four rows "different person" wrongly:
 *
 *   "CHANDRA, HARISH & S RADHAKRISHNAN"  read as "Radhakrishnan Chandra" because a bare
 *   second party inherits the first's surname. The card said Saranya Radhakrishnan — the
 *   roll AGREED with it, and we reported a conflict.
 *
 *   "PAIGE, JESSICA A & GRINSHPOON,ALEXA"  on a card whose insured is Grinshpoon and whose
 *   co-insured is Jessica Paige. The same two people in the other order, reported as a
 *   stranger on the deed.
 *
 * Both were already solved in wiipOwnerOverride yesterday — secondParty() for the surname,
 * cardHoldsOtherOwner for the swap — and this file reimplemented the question weakly
 * instead of reusing the answer. secondParty is now imported rather than copied, because a
 * second copy is how the two drift apart again.
