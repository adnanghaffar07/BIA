/**
 * Deep Skip Trace Blast over an effective-date range (Frank Sep-2026).
 *
 *   GET  /api/admin/skiptrace-blast?effectiveDate=&effectiveTo=&grade=A[&…]
 *        FREE. What the blast would do: eligible count, what it skips and why,
 *        and the credit CEILING.
 *   POST same params [&chunk=25]
 *        Traces up to `chunk` leads and returns progress. Call again until
 *        done — see "Why chunks" below.
 *
 * Under /api/admin so middleware restricts it to admin + superadmin: one click
 * here can spend thousands of credits, which is not a producer-level action.
 *
 * ── Why chunks ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The existing /api/admin/skiptrace-batch traces its whole cohort inside one
 * request. Frank's pre-launch checklist (Tier 3) flags exactly what that costs:
 * a serverless timeout kills it mid-run with credits already spent and no
 * checkpoint, so nobody can tell which leads were charged. This route does one
 * bounded chunk per request and commits each lead as it goes.
 *
 * It needs no cursor to resume: a traced lead gets deepSkipTracedAt stamped and
 * therefore drops out of the eligible set, so "the next chunk" is always just
 * the first N still-eligible leads. Re-running after a crash, a closed laptop or
 * a Stop click picks up exactly where it left off and can never re-charge a lead
 * it already traced.
 *
 * ── Cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Tracerfy bills 15 credits for a hit and 0 for a miss, so the GET estimate is a
 * ceiling, not a charge. Actual spend comes back per chunk.
 */

/**
 * The blast runs one grade at a time, and never a mix.
 *
 * It was Grade A only — Frank's request, and a guard against a mis-click over the whole
 * book. Grade B is now allowed because he asked for it on 28 Sep ("Email outreach may be
 * more important on these accounts than Grade As since we don't have a band price"), but
 * the two remain SEPARATE runs rather than one widened one.
 *
 * They are not the same decision. A Grade A trace chases an address for an account that is
 * already priced with the carrier work done — the value of the address is known. A Grade B
 * trace is speculative: 3,482 leads, no band price, and at 15 credits a hit that is a
 * five-figure bet. Merging them would let one click spend the second budget while somebody
 * believed they were approving the first.
