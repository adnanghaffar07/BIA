 * ── Why a decision needs a name against it ──────────────────────────────────
 * "Failures go to a review list, not into a send." What releases an address is a person
 * saying it belongs to the insured, so the row records who said it. An approval with no
 * name on it is indistinguishable from the silent release the rule exists to prevent — and
 * if an address turns out to have been a stranger's, the question afterwards is always who
 * cleared it and on what basis.
 *
 * The actor comes from the session, never from the request body.
