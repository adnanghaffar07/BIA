/**
 * POST /api/webhooks/campaign — outcomes from the campaign platform.
 *
 * This is what makes the integration live instead of something a producer has to go
 * and check in the vendor's dashboard.
 *
 * Three policies worth stating, because each one is a deliberate choice:
 *
 *  1. AUTH — the vendor does not sign payloads, so a shared secret arrives on the
 *     `x-bia-campaign-key` header and is compared in constant time. Unconfigured in
 *     production means refuse, not allow.
 *
 *  2. NO MATCH IS NOT AN ERROR — a payload we cannot tie to a local row is
 *     acknowledged with 200 and `matched: false`. It usually means the lead was added
 *     directly in the vendor's dashboard and never touched this CRM. Returning an
 *     error there would make the vendor retry forever over something that is working
 *     as intended. Nothing is ever created speculatively: we only update outcomes for
 *     sends this CRM actually initiated.
 *
 *  3. REAL FAILURES RETURN 5xx — so the vendor's own retry re-delivers later. An
 *     unrecognised event type is acknowledged and ignored; a database error is not.
 *
 * This route is public by necessity (the vendor cannot authenticate as a CRM user),
 * so it must stay on the middleware's PUBLIC_PATHS list while the header check above
 * carries the whole security burden.
