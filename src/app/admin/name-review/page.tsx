/**
 * The surname review queue, as a person works it (Frank, 24 Sep 2026 · second email §7).
 *
 * "A surname match between every skip-trace-recovered address and the insured or
 *  co-insured. Failures go to a review list, not into a send."
 *
 * ── Why this screen exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The rule has been enforced since it was written: the send list and the push both refuse a
 * held address. What did not exist was any way to CLEAR one. So "held pending review" meant
 * held forever, and on 29 Sep that was 683 addresses we had paid to recover sitting behind
 * a door with no handle on it.
 *
 * ── Why it is built wide rather than dense ──────────────────────────────────
 * Ruben works this, between calls, not in a long sitting. The decision is a glance —
 * "is mjgarcia@… Maria Garcia?" — and everything on the row exists to make that glance
 * possible without opening the lead. Both names, the property, and the matcher's own
 * reasoning, because "nothing in this matches" and "this is four letters of the surname"
 * are different questions even though both land here.
 *
 * ── Why there is no bulk approve ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Rejecting in bulk is safe: it holds addresses that were already held. Approving in bulk is
 * how 600 rows get cleared in four clicks by somebody who has stopped reading, which is
 * precisely the failure the rule was written to prevent. Approving is one row at a time, on
 * purpose.
